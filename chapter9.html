          <h2>Digital Society and Computer Ethics</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>digital society</strong> is a society where digital technologies like the internet, smartphones, and computers are deeply integrated into everyday life. It impacts how we communicate, work, learn, and entertain ourselves. The rise of digital technologies has transformed traditional systems, enabling faster communication, remote work, and access to vast amounts of information. However, it also brings challenges like privacy concerns, digital divide, and cybercrime.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Challenges of Digital Society</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy Concerns</strong>: Personal data is often collected and misused by companies and hackers. For example, social media platforms collect user data for targeted advertising, which can lead to privacy violations.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Divide</strong>: Inequality in access to technology creates a gap between those who have access to digital tools and those who do not. Rural areas and low-income groups often lack access to high-speed internet and modern devices.</li>
            <li><strong>Cybercrime</strong>: The increasing reliance on digital systems has led to a rise in cybercrime, including hacking, phishing, and identity theft.</li>
            <li><strong>Misinformation</strong>: The spread of fake news and propaganda on digital platforms can manipulate public opinion and cause social unrest.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h3>Computer Ethics</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Computer ethics</strong> involves the ethical use of technology, ensuring it benefits society without causing harm. It includes respecting privacy, avoiding harm, and promoting fairness. Computer ethics is crucial in guiding the development and use of technology to ensure it aligns with societal values.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Commandments of Computer Ethics</h3>

        <!-- Information Security -->
        <section id="information-security">
          <h2>Concept of Information Security</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Information security</strong> involves protecting data and information systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, or destruction. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Information security is critical for individuals, businesses, and governments to protect sensitive data from cyber threats.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Information Security Principles</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized users. For example, encrypting sensitive emails to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: Maintaining the accuracy and consistency of data. For example, using checksums to detect data tampering.</li>
            <li><strong>Availability</strong>: Ensuring data is accessible when needed. For example, using backup systems to recover data after a cyberattack.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <div class="example">
            <strong>Example</strong>: A bank uses encryption to protect customer data during online transactions, ensuring confidentiality and integrity.

        <!-- Malicious Software and Spam -->
        <section id="malware-spam">
          <h2>Malicious Software and Spam</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Malicious software (malware)</strong> includes viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware designed to harm or exploit systems. <strong>Spam</strong> refers to unsolicited messages, often sent in bulk, typically for advertising or phishing purposes.

        <!-- Protection from Cybercrime -->
        <section id="protection">
          <h2>Protection from Cybercrime</h2>
          <p>
            Protecting yourself from cybercrime involves using strong passwords, keeping software updated, and being cautious online. Tools like antivirus software, firewalls, and encryption can also help.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Best Practices</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Use strong, unique passwords</strong>: Avoid using common passwords like "123456" or "password."</li>
            <li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)</strong>: Adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid clicking on suspicious links</strong>: Be cautious of emails or messages from unknown sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Regularly update software</strong>: Install updates to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Use antivirus and anti-malware software</strong>: Protects against malware and other threats.</li>

        <!-- Digital Signature -->
        <section id="digital-signature">
          <h2>Concept of Digital Signature</h2>
          <p>
            A <strong>digital signature</strong> is a cryptographic tool used to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents. It ensures that a document has not been altered and confirms the identity of the sender.
          </p>
    
          <h3>Working Mechanism of Digital Signature</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A unique digital fingerprint is created for the document.</li>
            <li>The fingerprint is encrypted using the sender's private key.</li>
            <li>The recipient decrypts it using the sender's public key to verify authenticity.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h3>Advantages of Digital Signature</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensures document authenticity and integrity.</li>
            <li>Reduces the risk of forgery.</li>
            <li>Saves time and resources compared to physical signatures.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <h3>Disadvantages of Digital Signature</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Requires technical knowledge to implement.</li>
            <li>Dependent on the security of the private key.</li>
            <li>Legal recognition may vary by country.</li>
          </ul>
    
          <div class="example">
