        Multitasking is a technique that allows an operating system to execute
        more than one task simultaneously. It gives the illusion of concurrent
        execution by rapidly switching between tasks. In preemptive
        multitasking, the OS controls when tasks are switched, while in
        cooperative multitasking, the tasks themselves decide when to yield
        control.
      </p>

          <h2>2. What are the types of Operating Systems?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>There are several types of operating systems, each designed for different purposes:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Batch Operating System</b>: Executes a batch of jobs without user interaction. Jobs are grouped and processed in batches.</li>
                  <li><b>Time-Sharing Operating System</b>: Allows multiple users to share system resources simultaneously. Each user gets a small time slice.</li>
                  <li><b>Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)</b>: Used for applications that require real-time processing, such as embedded systems.</li>
                  <li><b>Distributed Operating System</b>: Manages a group of independent computers that appear to the user as a single system.</li>
                  <li><b>Network Operating System</b>: Manages network resources and allows computers to connect and communicate over a network.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
      </div>
      
      <div class="question">
          <h2>3. What is a Process in an Operating System?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>A process is a program in execution. It is an active entity that contains the program code and its current activity. A process has several components:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Program Counter (PC)</b>: Keeps track of the address of the next instruction to be executed.</li>
                  <li><b>Process Stack</b>: Stores temporary data such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables.</li>
                  <li><b>Data Section</b>: Stores global variables used by the process.</li>
                  <li><b>Heap</b>: Used for dynamic memory allocation during the execution of the program.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Processes can be in various states, including New, Ready, Running, Waiting, and Terminated.</p>

      <div class="question">
          <h2>4. What is Memory Management in an Operating System?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>Memory Management is a function of the OS that manages the computer's memory resources. It allocates memory to processes, keeps track of memory usage, and ensures that one process does not interfere with the memory of another process.</p>
              <p>The main memory management techniques include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Contiguous Memory Allocation</b>: Assigns a single contiguous block of memory to a process.</li>
                  <li><b>Paging</b>: Divides memory into fixed-size pages and divides processes into pages for non-contiguous allocation.</li>
                  <li><b>Segmentation</b>: Divides memory into variable-sized segments, such as code, data, and stack segments.</li>
                  <li><b>Virtual Memory</b>: Uses a portion of the hard drive as if it were additional RAM, allowing the system to handle larger programs.</li>
              </ul>

      <div class="question">
          <h2>5. What is File Management in an Operating System?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>File Management is the part of the operating system responsible for organizing, storing, and retrieving files. It provides an interface for users and programs to interact with files on storage devices.</p>
              <p>The key components of file management include:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>File System</b>: A method for organizing files on storage devices, such as FAT, NTFS, or ext4.</li>
                  <li><b>File Operations</b>: Includes creating, reading, writing, deleting, and renaming files.</li>
                  <li><b>File Access Methods</b>: Defines how data is accessed in files, such as sequential or direct access.</li>
                  <li><b>Directories</b>: Structures used to organize files into hierarchical folders or directories.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>File management ensures efficient storage and retrieval of files, allowing users to organize data effectively.</p>

          <h2>6. What is a Deadlock in an Operating System?</h2>
          <div class="answer">
              <p>A deadlock is a situation in an operating system where two or more processes are unable to proceed because they are each waiting for the other to release a resource. Deadlock can lead to a system halt or indefinite waiting.</p>
              <p>The four conditions for a deadlock are:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><b>Mutual Exclusion</b>: Resources cannot be shared between processes.</li>
                  <li><b>Hold and Wait</b>: Processes holding resources are waiting for additional resources.</li>
                  <li><b>No Preemption</b>: Resources cannot be forcibly taken away from processes.</li>
                  <li><b>Circular Wait</b>: A circular chain of processes exists where each process is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Deadlock prevention, avoidance, and detection techniques are used to handle deadlock situations.</p>
